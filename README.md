 # Who is @fritzlerilan?
## About Me 👨‍🦱
- 👋 Hi, I’m @fritzlerilan better known as Ilan :).
- 🌊 I live in Mar del Plata, Argentina. A beatiful city aside the sea. 
- 👀 I am interested in learning how to be a backend developer but I want to be a fullstack developer. I really like to understand the logic of things.
- 💎 In 2020, I discovered that programming is what I want to do and what I want to live for. I don't think there are words to describe how much I like it, it is a feeling that you know it instantly.

## Where I study 📖
- 👩‍🎓 I started studying Programming at the UTN - Mar del Plata in 2020. My university studies have not been completed. Even so, my self-taught learning is constant.

- 🤓 In my spare time, I study some new technology or seek to reinforce something I already know by taking courses on Udemy. I am also very interested in participating in trainings!
     

# Skills 🔑

## JavaScript 🌐

- I am currently learning JavaScript from a very comprehensive course on Udemy. Particularly [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-moderno-guia-definitiva-construye-10-proyectos/). In my repository you can see the things I have been doing with this language and this course i was mentioned. At the moment it is the language that I am using the most.

## Python 🐍

- This is my second and for a long time my primary language i've been used and i love it because of its community and how it makes the things easier to develop. I work with frameworks like Flask, FastAPI and Django.

## C 👨‍💻

- C is the first language I knew. I was learned in college and i love it because of its complexity. This language was helped me to figure out the logic of things and how all works behind the scenes. 

## Git 🖇️

- I learned how to use Git in a Udemy course and thanks to that I know this platform. I put it to constant use for tomorrow when I get to work as a developer and have to know the application well.

## SCRUM ⌚

- I also learned about this agile methodology through Udemy. I have not been able to put it into practice yet, I hope to be able to apply it soon. I find it very interesting and functional for the IT world.
